# Lesson 1.4: Tactile and Internal Sensors: IMUs, Force/Torque, and Temperature

In the last lesson, we learned how a robot **sees the world** (external perception).  
Now, we will look inside the robot. This lesson focuses on **internal sensors**, which are crucial for stable movement and safe interaction.

## Introduction & Hook

If cameras are the robot's **eyes**, internal sensors are its **inner ear, sense of touch, and temperature regulation**.  
These sensors tell the robot about its own state:

- Am I accelerating?  
- Am I tilted?  
- Am I pushing too hard?

> Roboticists call these internal senses **Proprioception**—the robot's awareness of its body's position and movement.  
> Without these internal sensors, a robot cannot maintain balance, walk straight, or safely manipulate fragile objects.

## Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

The **IMU** is the most vital internal sensor for movement—it acts as the robot's **inner ear**.  

### Components of an IMU

1. **Accelerometers:** Measure non-gravitational acceleration (how quickly the robot is speeding up or slowing down).  
2. **Gyroscopes:** Measure angular velocity (rotation around the x, y, z axes).  
3. **Magnetometers:** Measure the magnetic field (like a compass, for orientation).

### Why the IMU is Essential for Balance

IMUs are often placed in the **torso near the Center of Mass (CoM)**. They feed data into the **control loop**:

- **Gravity:** Detects which way is down.  
- **Orientation:** Combines gyro and accelerometer data to estimate tilt.  
- **Velocity Estimation:** Acceleration is integrated over time to compute speed and position.  

> IMU data is noisy, so filters like **Kalman Filters** are used to produce stable estimates.

## Force/Torque Sensors and Tactile Sensors

Robots need to **feel the environment** using contact sensors.

### Force/Torque (F/T) Sensors

- Placed on **wrists** and **ankles**.  
- Measure 3 forces (`F_x, F_y, F_z`) and 3 torques (`τ_x, τ_y, τ_z`).  

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Ankles | Measure ground reaction to control CoM and balance |
| Wrists | Prevent crushing objects when grasping |

### Tactile (Touch) Sensors

- Arrays of small pressure sensors covering hands or arms (artificial skin).  
- Enable **delicate manipulation**, e.g., handling an egg or assembling small components.

## Internal Health Monitoring (Temperature)

Motors generate heat when running. **Temperature sensors** monitor motors and batteries.  

- **Thermal Policy:** If temperature exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80°C), the AI reduces power or stops movement to prevent damage.  

> Critical for **safety and longevity** of the robot.

## Brainstorming Challenge: The Slippery Floor

A robot is walking across an icy, slippery floor:

1. Which **external sensor** (from Lesson 1.3) is useless for detecting the slip?  
2. Which **internal sensor** (from this lesson) would detect it first, and how?

## Key Concepts in Action

| Concept | Function | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMU | Measures acceleration, rotation, and gravity | Used as the robot's "inner ear" for tilt and balance |
| Proprioception | Robot's awareness of its own body state | Knowing elbow is bent at 90° and motors are warm |
| F/T Sensor | Measures forces and torques | Controls pressure on ground to maintain CoM stability |
| Thermal Policy | Manages motor and battery heat | AI reduces motor speed to prevent overheating |

## Self-Test Questions

**Q1:** What three components are combined inside an IMU?  
**A1:** Accelerometers, Gyroscopes, and Magnetometers.

**Q2:** What does a Force/Torque (F/T) sensor on a wrist measure?  
**A2:** Forces and torques applied to an object, preventing damage.

**Q3:** What is the technical term for a robot's awareness of its body state?  
**A3:** Proprioception.

**Q4:** If a motor's temperature sensor reports 100°C, what should the AI do?  
**A4:** Trigger a **Thermal Policy**: reduce power or stop the motor to prevent damage.

**Q5:** Why is integrating accelerometer data alone insufficient for precise positioning?  
**A5:** Raw data is noisy, and errors accumulate (drift); fusion with gyroscope data is needed for accuracy.
