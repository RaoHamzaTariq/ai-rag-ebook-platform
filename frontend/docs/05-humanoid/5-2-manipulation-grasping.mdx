# Lesson 5.2: Manipulation & Grasping with Humanoid Hands

This lesson covers the principles of robotic **manipulation**, the role of **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)** in complex arm movements, and how **force control** is used for delicate grasping tasks.

---

## Introduction & Hook

- If locomotion (Lesson 5.1) is the ultimate balancing act, **manipulation** is the ultimate precision act.  
- Even the best walking robot is useless in human environments if it **cannot interact with objects**.  
- Manipulation involves moving a robot’s arm into a position and applying **exact force** to interact with objects without dropping or crushing them.

## The Kinematics of Manipulation

### Degrees of Freedom (DoF)

- **DoF** defines the number of independent joint movements.  
- Human-like robot arms often mimic the shoulder, elbow, and wrist:

| Component | Typical DoF | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arm | 7 DoF | Allows reaching any point around the shoulder; redundant manipulator |
| Hand/Gripper | 1–12+ DoF | Simple grippers have 1 DoF; complex hands have many for fine manipulation |

- A **redundant manipulator** has more joints than the 6 required to position a point (3 for position, 3 for orientation).

## Position Control vs. Force Control

| Control Type | Function | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Position Control** | Moves the hand/joint to a target location | Free-space motion (approaching an object) |
| **Force Control** | Maintains/apply a specific force | Contact tasks (grasping, pushing, sanding) |

---

## Grasping: Applying Just Enough Force

- **Grasping**: Picking up an object while controlling the applied force.  
- Key decisions:
  1. **Grasp type**  
  2. **Applied force**

### Grasping Types

| Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Grasp** | For heavy/large objects; uses full hand strength | Holding a soda bottle |
| **Precision Grasp** | For delicate/small objects; fingertips only | Picking up a screw or pen |

---

## The Role of Force Control

- To counteract gravity, gripping force must satisfy:  
  F (friction) ​≥ W  
- **F/T sensors** in wrist/fingers provide real-time feedback.  
- The controller adjusts motor current continuously to maintain **perfect pressure**.

---

## Conceptual Grasping Pipeline

1. Detect object and determine position (vision system).  
2. Plan arm trajectory using **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**.  
3. Move hand using **Position Control** to target.  
4. Apply **Force Control** for stable grasp.  
5. Lift and manipulate object as needed.

## Brainstorming Challenge: Grasping the Raw Egg

- Task: Pick up a raw egg and place it in a carton without breaking it.  
- Questions:  
  1. Which **grasp type** should the robot use?  
  2. Why combine **Position Control** for approach with **Force Control** for gripping?

---

## Key Concepts in Action

| Concept | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manipulation** | Use arms and hands to interact with the environment | Opening a door, picking up a cup |
| **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)** | Number of independent joint movements | 7 DoF arm enables dexterity |
| **Force Control** | Apply precise force against an object | Grasping fragile objects |
| **Precision Grasp** | Fingertip-only hold for delicate objects | Picking up a key or egg |

## Self-Test Q&A

**Q1:** What does DoF stand for, and what does it measure?  
**A1:** **Degrees of Freedom**; measures independent joints/movements in the arm or hand.

**Q2:** What is the primary difference between Position Control and Force Control?  
**A2:** Position Control moves the hand to a location; Force Control regulates the applied force when in contact with an object.

**Q3:** Which type of grasp is most suitable for picking up a heavy bag of concrete?  
**A3:** **Power Grasp**.

**Q4:** What sensor measures the force applied to prevent crushing an object?  
**A4:** **Force/Torque (F/T) Sensor**.

**Q5:** Why is a 7 DoF arm considered a redundant manipulator?  
**A5:** It has more joints than the 6 needed to position and orient the hand in 3D space, allowing obstacle avoidance.
