# Lesson 5.1: Bipedal Locomotion and Balance Control

Bipedal locomotion is the complex engineering challenge of creating a **stable, controlled walking motion on two legs**, managed primarily by the **Zero Moment Point (ZMP) control method**.

---

## Introduction & Hook

- Walking seems effortless for humans but is mathematically complex for robots.  
- Unlike four-legged robots (naturally stable), humanoids are constantly in **controlled falling**.  
- The **IMUs, motors, and real-time control loop** must work in harmony to solve:  
  > How to keep a tall, heavy object balanced on a constantly shifting, tiny base?

This is the core challenge of **Bipedal Locomotion**.

## Bipedal Locomotion: The Challenge of Instability

Bipedal robots transition between two phases:

| Phase | Description | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Double Support Phase** | Both feet on the ground | Momentarily stable; CoM inside large Support Polygon |
| **Single Support Phase (Swing)** | One foot lifted forward | Most unstable; CoM must be carefully managed |

- The overall walking pattern is called the **Gait**.  
- A well-designed gait **minimizes time in the unstable single support phase** and ensures smooth transitions.

## The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Control

- The **ZMP** is the point on the ground where the total forces (gravity + robot accelerations) create **zero torque**.  
- **Why ZMP Matters:**
  - **Static vs Dynamic Balance:** When standing still, ZMP ≈ CoM projection.  
  - During movement, the **desired ZMP trajectory** predicts where feet must be placed.  
  - Motor controllers adjust joint torques to follow this trajectory closely.

## Locomotion Planning Pipeline

Walking requires real-time calculations. The pipeline is:

1. **Gait Planning:** Determine footstep sequence and placement.  
2. **ZMP Trajectory Generation:** Calculate the ideal ZMP path for the gait.  
3. **Inverse Kinematics (IK) Generation:** Compute required joint angles (hips, knees, ankles) for balance.  
4. **Motor Execution:** Send joint commands to actuators.  
5. **Feedback:** IMU and Force/Torque sensors measure actual balance and correct subsequent steps.

## Brainstorming Challenge: ZMP and Environmental Changes

- Scenario: Robot walks on a **soft, compliant carpet**.  
- Questions:  
  1. How does the carpet affect F/T sensor readings and calculated ZMP?  
  2. Why is sensor feedback essential for completing steps on unpredictable surfaces?

## Key Concepts in Action

| Concept | Function | Importance in Locomotion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bipedal Locomotion** | Walking on two legs | Enables mobility in human environments (stairs, narrow spaces) |
| **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)** | Point where inertial and gravitational forces balance | Must stay inside Support Polygon to prevent falling |
| **Support Polygon (SP)** | Area enclosed by foot contact points | Defines the stable zone for the ZMP |
| **Gait** | Specific walking pattern (foot timing, step length) | Pre-planned for smooth, efficient motion |

## Self-Test Q&A

**Q1:** What are the two main phases of bipedal locomotion, and which one is the most unstable?  
**A1:** **Double Support** and **Single Support** (most unstable).  

**Q2:** Where must the ZMP always fall for the robot to maintain balance?  
**A2:** Inside the **Support Polygon (SP)**.  

**Q3:** What is the primary role of the IMU in locomotion?  
**A3:** Provides real-time feedback on acceleration and tilt to detect and correct errors.  

**Q4:** When standing still, what is the relationship between ZMP and CoM?  
**A4:** The **ZMP and CoM projection are essentially the same point**.  

**Q5:** After generating the ZMP trajectory, what calculation must be done before sending commands to motors?  
**A5:** **Inverse Kinematics (IK) Generation** (calculating joint angles).
