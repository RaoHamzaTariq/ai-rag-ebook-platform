# Lesson 2.3: Robot Description: URDF/SDF for Humanoid Kinematics

To control a robot, the software needs a **precise mathematical model** of the robot's body. This lesson explains **URDF** and **SDF**, the key file formats used to define a robot’s structure, mass, and movement capabilities.

## Introduction & Hook

If a human wants to pick up a cup, the brain knows the **length of the forearm, elbow position, and wrist angle**.  

A robot's AI requires the same information in a **digital blueprint** stored in an XML file, defining **geometry, sensors, and actuators**.

## Defining the Robot's Body: URDF

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** is the standard in ROS for describing a robot.  

### 1. Links (The Bones)

- A **Link** is a rigid, non-moving part (e.g., torso, upper arm, hand).  
- Each link has:
  - **Geometry** (shape)  
  - **Mass** ($m$)  
  - **Inertia** (resistance to rotation)  

### 2. Joints (The Hinges)

- Connect two links and define **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**.  
- Types of joints:
  - **Revolute**: Rotation around a single axis (common in elbows/knees)  
  - **Prismatic**: Linear movement along an axis  

---

## SDF: The Simulation Blueprint

- **SDF (Simulation Description Format)** is used for more complex simulations (Gazebo).  
- Can handle **loops** and define **environmental properties** like friction and lighting.  

---

## Coordinate Frames and Kinematics

### The Coordinate Frame System

- Every link and joint has a **local $x, y, z$ axis system**.  
- Frames are **chained**: shoulder → torso, elbow → shoulder, etc.  
- Global position is calculated by combining all transformations from the **base frame**.

### Kinematics: The Math of Motion

- **Forward Kinematics (FK)**: Given joint angles, calculates the position of the end-effector.  
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Given the desired end-effector position, calculates the required joint angles.  

> IK is computationally complex for robots with many DOFs.

## Conceptual Code Example: URDF Snippet

```xml
<!-- 1. Define the first Link (shoulder) -->
<link name="shoulder_link">
  <visual>
    <geometry><box size="0.1 0.2 0.1"/></geometry>
  </visual>
  <inertial>
    <mass value="5.0"/> 
    <inertia ixx="0.1" iyy="0.1" izz="0.1"/> 
  </inertial>
</link>

<!-- 2. Define the second Link (upper arm) -->
<link name="upper_arm_link">
  <visual>
    <geometry><cylinder radius="0.05" length="0.3"/></geometry>
  </visual>
</link>

<!-- 3. Define the Joint (connection between them) -->
<joint name="shoulder_roll_joint" type="revolute">
  <parent link="shoulder_link"/>
  <child link="upper_arm_link"/>
  <axis xyz="1 0 0"/> 
  <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57"/> 
</joint>

## Brainstorming Challenge: Kinematics vs. Dynamics

A robotics engineer is asked to write two programs for a robot hand:

1. Calculate the exact path a fingertip travels given joint angles.
2. Determine the **minimum torque** required by motors to lift a 1 kg weight.

**Question:** Which program uses **Kinematics** and which uses **Dynamics** (motion *with forces*)?

## Key Concepts in Action

| Concept                     | Definition                                                | Importance                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **URDF/SDF**                | XML format defining robot structure (links, joints, mass) | Essential for AI to know robot geometry and limits           |
| **Link**                    | Rigid body part (bone) with mass and inertia              | Used to calculate forces and stability (CoM)                 |
| **Joint**                   | Connection between two links defining DOFs                | Determines how the robot can move                            |
| **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** | Calculates joint angles for a target position             | Crucial for goal-oriented tasks (walking, grabbing, pushing) |
