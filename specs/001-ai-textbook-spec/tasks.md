# Tasks for AI-Native Textbook: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Implementation Strategy
This task list is designed for incremental delivery, focusing on completing each section before moving to the next. The goal is to generate an immediately executable plan for an AI agent or human contributor.

## Dependencies
Chapters can be planned and written largely in parallel once the overall structure is established. Review and refinement tasks for each chapter depend on the writing and technical content tasks for that chapter. Final assembly depends on all chapters being complete and formatted.

## Output Summary

*   **Total Task Count**: 57
*   **Task Count per User Story (example for 2 chapters, will scale for all)**:
    *   Chapter Planning & Structure: 7 tasks (per chapter)
    *   Writing Tasks: 5 tasks (per chapter)
    *   Technical Content Tasks: 3-4 tasks (per chapter)
    *   MDX Formatting Tasks: 4 tasks (per chapter)
    *   Review & Refinement: 5 tasks (per chapter)
    *   Metadata Preparation: 3 tasks (per chapter)
    *   Final Assembly: 4 tasks
*   **Parallel Opportunities Identified**: Many tasks within planning, technical content creation, MDX formatting, and metadata preparation for different chapters can be parallelized, as indicated by `[P]` markers.
*   **Independent Test Criteria for each story**: Each user story/chapter section (e.g., "Draft Chapter 1 Content") is designed to be a logically complete unit, allowing for independent review and validation of its output before integration.
*   **Suggested MVP Scope**: Chapters could be considered individually deliverable MVPs. A foundational MVP would be completing Chapter 1 through all phases.
