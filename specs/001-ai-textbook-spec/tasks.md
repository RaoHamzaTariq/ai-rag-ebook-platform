## Phase 5: Final Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T085 Consolidate all chapter metadata into `content/_data/rag-metadata.json`
- [ ] T086 Final review of all MDX files for overall consistency (terminology, tone, formatting) across the entire book.
- [ ] T087 Verify the complete repository structure is ready for frontend (Docusaurus) and RAG system ingestion.

## Dependencies

- Chapter-specific content writing tasks (T005, T010, etc.) are independent and can be parallelized.
- Code snippet and diagram integration tasks (T007, T008, etc.) depend on the respective chapter content being drafted.
- Metadata generation (T009, T014, etc.) depends on the chapter structure being defined and content being present to determine page numbers/markers.
- Review and editing tasks (T055, T058, etc.) depend on all content and technical assets for that chapter being complete.
- Final consolidation of metadata (T085) depends on metadata generation for all chapters.
- Final repository verification (T087) depends on all chapters being finalized and formatted.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Chapters 1 and 2 content drafting can proceed in parallel (T005-T006 and T010-T011).
- Code snippet insertion for Chapter 1 (T007) and diagram creation for Chapter 1 (T008) can be parallelized once the content is drafted.
- Review and editing for different chapters (e.g., T055 and T058) can occur in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The development will follow an iterative and incremental approach. We will prioritize completing each chapter's content and initial formatting before moving to RAG-specific metadata generation and final validation. An MVP could focus on completing the first few foundational chapters (e.g., Chapters 1-3) through both authoring and RAG readiness phases to establish the full content pipeline.
